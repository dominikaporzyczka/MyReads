# MyReads Project
Project made for passing the course Udacity: Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree. This is the MyReads App that allows you to track your read. You can move book to another shelf and you also can search new books and add them to one of three shelves - "Currently reading", "Want to read", "Read"

## How to use:
* Clone or download repository
* install all project dependencies with npm install
* start the development server with npm start

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches don't come back with any results.
